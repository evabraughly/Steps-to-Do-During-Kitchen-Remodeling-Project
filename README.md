<h2>Steps to Do During Kitchen Remodeling Project</h2>

Learning how to remodel a kitchen is a rite of passage for many homeowners, considering it’s the most popular remodeling project after bathrooms. Like any renovation, there are essential steps to take when you remodel a kitchen, all of which require careful planning and a big helping of patience.

A DIY <a href="https://www.kitchenremodelingelpasotx.com/outdoor-kitchen-installation-el-paso-texas/">kitchen remodeling</a> doesn’t have to be difficult, however. We’ll cover what parts of a kitchen remodel any homeowner can handle themselves, as well as when to bring in professional help to ensure a successful and efficient kitchen remodel.

Gather ideas for Your Kitchen Remodel & Sketch It Out
The first step in a kitchen remodel is the easiest – decide what you want. Start your search for inspiration by browsing your favorite Pinterest boards and home improvement sites, and save ideas in a folder or vision board as you research to help develop your remodeling plans. Viewing a broad range of layouts and designs is helpful to identify the fixtures, textures, and materials you want in your new kitchen. You should also consider how your kitchen will be used and whether your new design will fit within the existing floorplan.

When you have some (realistic) ideas in mind, draw up a general outline of the remodel. Your main focus should be figuring out the layout of the room. A crucial stage in the design process is to determine how far apart your cabinets will be spaced out, where your kitchen island will be situated, where appliances will go, and other logistical details. Knowing the precise layout will also give potential contractors an idea of the scope of the work, making it easier to get ballpark estimates for your kitchen remodeling project.

<b>Create a Budget and Desired Timeline for the Kitchen Remodel</b>

Once you have an idea of what your dream kitchen would look like, it’s time to determine how much it will cost. Perform some research to come up with a solid foundation for your kitchen remodel budget. While it’s tough to determine exactly how much a kitchen renovation will cost this early in the process, establishing a budget ceiling now will allow you to start getting in touch with professionals.

You should also have a general idea of how long your kitchen remodel will take so you can prepare yourself for the big project you’re taking on. While timelines vary depending on several factors, such as the size of your kitchen, the scope of work being done, and any contractors you may be working with, experts estimate a kitchen remodel can take anywhere from one to three months.

<b>Call in the Professionals</b>

There’s a professional out there for just about every facet of a major kitchen remodel, from granite countertops to custom kitchen cabinetry to managing the entire project itself. Your task is to use your friends, colleagues, and good old research to find the best professionals to realize your unique designs. A good place to start is to visit big-box stores and showrooms to get a look at every material available to you, and possibly pick up a few referrals along the way.

Assuming you haven’t reached out to a licensed contractor yet, you should do so once the budget, layout, and overall design are finalized. A good rule of thumb is to get at least three different estimates that include timetables for completion. Do a walkaround with each prospective contractor to go over every aspect of the kitchen remodel and to get a sense of whether you may need to add or subtract from your budget.

However, even if you are aiming for an inexpensive DIY kitchen remodel, you should never take the low-ball bid when hiring help for a renovation. Low estimates indicate a contractor may be desperate for work and/or plans on using low-quality materials.

Once you’ve picked a contractor to assist in your kitchen remodeling project, draw up a contract that outlines the scope of the work and establishes a payment schedule. A typical payment schedule provides 10 percent upfront, 25 percent at three-stage intervals throughout the project, and the last 15 percent upon project completion. 

**Put Your Kitchen Back Together**

When you’re ready to put the remodeled kitchen back together, we recommend this order of steps to complete your renovation:

• Configure plumbing and electrical. 
• Paint the room.
• Install new flooring.
• Add kitchen cabinets.
• Install countertops.
• Place large appliances.

Hiring a reliable and experienced kitchen remodeling contractor will help you have peace of mind that the work will be done properly.
